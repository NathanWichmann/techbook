## Description 
The motivation for our Techbook application was to allow new developers to meet, see each other’s work on Github and view profiles. One of the key elements of a new developers 
journey whether through a BootCamp or being self-taught, is to create a Profile. This profile helps potential Recruiters view more information about candidates and whether they would make a good fit with their team. Our team decided on this application based on the fact we have a common interest of finding employment after the course has completed. When a group has a common interest, they tend to come together easier and have a vested interested in a desired outcome. 
There are two profiles connected to this application, Linkedin and there is a section to add a http link to the users developed portfolio. This portfolio is shared with Recruiters and users alike. Users can generate ideas for their Portfolios by viewing different developers, which can generate new learning and ideas. 
The Recruiter can also see the Developer’s Linkedin profile to gage the desired employment and educational background. This information coupled with the Developers own deployed Portfolio, create a detailed picture of just how well of a fit a potential candidate really is. 
As a team we identified this exact problem, there is not a place that generates all the needed information for hiring managers. It is safe to say that this information can be gathered from a resume, however, a resume does not always create an accurate picture. This application brings together modern technology and a broader sense of the word resume. It is interactive and fun for users and recruiters alike. 
Learning in a group setting can sometimes be problematic. Different people have different ideas and different perceptions of how those ideas should be presented. Some of these problems were avoided as we all came together with a common interest and problem. A large portion of a developer’s career will be working in teams, understanding the dynamic of working with other people will be beneficial for future career success. 
One feature that the group would like to add in the future is a messenger service within the application. This would create an even more interactive user experience.


## Installation
Techbook uses node.js, sequelize, mySQL, express-handlebars, fomantic-ui and bcrypt. All of these technologies are in the package-json and can be added through a npm install
after the Open in Integrated Terminal is run on the server.js. All seeds have been generated to give the user a better understanding as to how the application works.
 

## Usage 
Techbook has two different types of users, Developer and a Recruiter. There is a signup option where the user checks if they are are Recruiter or a Developer. If they choose a Developer they given the option to determine if they are junior, intermidate or senior. Based on the experience the user picks they are given a badge that is placed to the left of their name. The Developer is given a Linkedin, Github and Portfolio link where other users can view their links. There is a section to add the tools, languages and frameworks they are familiar with. The user has an optional about me section where they can provide personal information. Then the majority of the user profile page consits of the users personal Github repositories, which are automatically generated. On the bottom there is a section to add the users main projects for recruiters to see what the user considers their best work. The last feature on the Developers profile page is the email option. An email of the user is automatically generated and anyone viewing the profile can email them directly and the comminication begins.
If the Recruiter box is checked, they are given a limited page as Recruiters are not viewed by Developers. 
The last page is the Seach by page. The Recruiter can search out desired candicates and the Delopers seek out other developers.
